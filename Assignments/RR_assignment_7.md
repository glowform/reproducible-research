
## Introduction to reporting

### Common document formats

Markdown (md), R Markdown (Rmd), Quarto(qmd), and IPython Notebooks (ipynb) are all formats used for creating documents that blend text, code, and visualizations, commonly employed in data science, research, and technical documentation. 


## Markdown

"Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor."

It's what's used for creating our presentations.

# Heading 1 Example

This is a simple example of Markdown formatting.

### Basic Formatting

You can use *italic*, **bold**, and ~~strikethrough~~ text.

### Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item 2.1
  - Sub-item 2.2

### Links and Images

You can [link to websites](https://www.example.com) and embed images:

## Exercise 2 - Quarto

Quarto is an open source publishing system for technical and scientific documents. It implements Markdown, allowing for integration with multiple languages, (e.g. R and Python).

Meant as a non-R-focused replacement for RMarkdown.

It allows:

- automated reports with dynamic fields based on data inputs
- clear code and results documentation
- presentations with direct code outputs etc.

Quarto workflow:

Quarto file – .Qmd
Markdown file – .md
Final output – .html/tex/pdf/others

(Note: it was similar for RMarkdown, with Rmd instead of qmd)

Make sure you have quarto installed (`install.packages("quarto")` and `library(quarto)`)

## Exercise 3 - Jupyter Notebooks

## Assignment 
1. Send me a link to your project repository (the one you're doing for this course), with your teammates added as collaborators.
2. Send me the html(zipped with images)/pdf/ipynb output of the example files we did today. Change some of the numeric values in the code. Make sure that it states you're the author and it has todays date.
