## What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a typesetting system commonly used for technical and scientific documents. It provides a professional-looking output and is particularly adept at handling complex mathematical equations and structures.

## Why Use LaTeX?
- Produces high-quality documents with consistent formatting.
- Excellent for academic papers, reports, theses, and presentations.
- Handles references, citations, and bibliographies efficiently.
- Facilitates collaboration and version control, especially when using platforms like Overleaf.

## Getting Started with Overleaf

Creating an Account: Visit Overleaf and sign up for an account.

## Presentations

Check the `presentation.tex` and `RR9.rmd` file for examples of presentations in LaTeX and RMD

## Assignment

Change the article tex document with your details. Change the equations (to something completely different) and an image. Also change the citation to load the second article (or add some bibliography entries of your own).

Do the same steps for presentation files (both tex and RMD).

Send me the three output PDF files via email.
