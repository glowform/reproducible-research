## What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is a typesetting system commonly used for technical and scientific documents. It provides a professional-looking output and is particularly adept at handling complex mathematical equations and structures.

## Why Use LaTeX?
- Produces high-quality documents with consistent formatting.
- Excellent for academic papers, reports, theses, and presentations.
- Handles references, citations, and bibliographies efficiently.
- Facilitates collaboration and version control, especially when using platforms like Overleaf.

## Getting Started with Overleaf

Creating an Account: Visit Overleaf and sign up for an account.

Creating a New Project: Click on "New Project" and choose a template or start from scratch.

Editor Layout: Familiarize yourself with the Overleaf editor, which consists of the code editor on the left and the preview pane on the right.

Basic Commands: Let's start with some basic LaTeX commands in Overleaf

## Presentations

Check the `presentation.tex` and `RR9.rmd` file for examples of presentations in LaTeX and RMD

## Assignment

Change the article tex document with your details. Change the equations (to something completely different) and an image. Add a model like linear regression or simple ML to RMD presentation. Also change the citation to load the second article (or add some bibliography entries of your own).

Do the same steps for presentation files (both tex and RMD).
