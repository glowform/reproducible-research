
## Working on reports

Today we will be working on a practical assignment based on what we have learned on the previous lesson.

## Assignment 

Deadline for this assignment is 25.04.2024 (DS) / 29.04.2024 (QF) and you will get 2 points for it (if done properly).

Create a new repository (either init it locally->github or github->local). 

Pick a TV show that had its premieres on TV and thus has some viewership numbers reported on Wikipedia. E.g. [Suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Suits_episodes) 

Then create a short report in Quarto/Jupyter (R or Python) that contains, for example:

1.  A brief description of the show (use headings, *italics*, **bold**, for names and text).
2.  A photo with the logo or a shot from the show itself.
3.  A summary of some basic statistics (e.g. on viewership or ratings).
4.  A graph of the viewership over time.
5.  A graph of the episode-to-episode (or season-to-season) changes in viewership.
6.  A short description of the observed changes that includes inline references to numbers (e.g. the viewership decreased by `insert_calculated_number` between seasons 3 and 5).
7.  Make sure your report looks nice -\> this time we're mostly interested in the output and not necessarily the codes used to achieve it.
8.  `render` your report and make sure everything is displaying properly.
9.  Commit the changes and push them to a Github repository.
10.  Send me a link to the repo by email.

(you can copy the content from Wikipedia or other pages for this task)

(try doing more than one commit for this, i.e. divide your work into steps!)
